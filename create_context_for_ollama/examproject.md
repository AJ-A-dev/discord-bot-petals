## Overview:
For the exam project you are required to design and implement a complete web application, frontend and backend.

You are free to chose what kind of application you implement, but restrictions apply to both [technology that you may use](#technology-allowed) and there is some [required functionality](#functional-requirements).

## Report
2 weeks after the start of the project, you have to upload a report describing the application that you want to implement.
The report must contain the following:

1. What does the application do?
2. What data is stored in files/ database?
3. An initial layout for your page.
   The initial layout can be created as a static HTML page, or simply as an image (e.g. you can use PowerPoint).

The report does not need to include all provided functionality, and you can change specific functionality, data and page layout. 
However, the overall theme for the page is binding.

*The report need to be uploaded to your roups github repository.*

## Project delivery
On the final delivery you should hand in your complete code, and a README.md markdown file.
Your code should also include a SQLite database or files including example data.

The `README.md` file should contain the following sections:

- How to run: e.g. 
    > Start the application by running `app.py` in the application folder.
- Instructions for testing, e.g. `username` and `password` for existing users.
- List of all functionality: List all implemented functionality, to make sure all your work is taken into account. For example
    * Preferences are stored in a cookie and present if the user revisits the page.
    * New categories can be added on the category pages. 
      * An Icon and color can be chosen for the category.
    * If the user tries to register a password with less than 5 characters, an Error is displayed.

# Project presentation

You will have to give a 5 minute presentation about your project.
The goal is that you give a demo, showing how your application works, and we will ask some questions about your code.
The presentation is mandatory and graded pass/fail.
If you fail the presentation, e.g. you show that you do not understand your own code, 
your project will not be graded.


## Help and plagiarism
You need to write the application code yourself, or within the group.

Note that this should not stop you from helping each other.
As long as you do not write code for your fellow students, but help them debug or design 
a certain functionality, it is not considered plagiarism.

We will also continue labs and offer help.
